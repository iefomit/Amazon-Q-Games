# 🕹️ PLATFORMER ADVENTURE

**Version 1.0**

A creative 5-level platformer built entirely using Amazon Q CLI—no initial codebase, just prompting and iteration.

---

## 🎮 Game Overview

Platformer Adventure is a browser-based side-scrolling game where players navigate through five progressively harder levels filled with coins, spikes, flying enemies, and moving platforms. The entire game was created using AI-generated prompts with Amazon Q CLI.

---

## 🌟 Features

* 🎮 **Double Jump Mechanics**
* 👾 **Flying Enemies with Wing Animation**
* 💰 **Coin Collection System with Visual Effects**
* ⚠️ **Spikes and Hazards That Cause Game Over**
* 🏆 **Five Hand-Crafted Levels with Progressive Difficulty**
* 🎯 **Start Screen, Game Over Screen, and Level Transition UI**
* 🧠 **AI-generated code, logic, and styling**

---

## 🧠 Why a Platformer?

A platformer pushes key game development concepts like:

* Gravity & jumping
* Platform collision detection
* Enemy movement and collision
* Coin and score management
* Level design and pacing

Amazon Q CLI let me focus purely on creativity. No setup, no boilerplate—just describe what you want.

## 💬 Prompting Techniques

**Effective prompting examples:**

* `Create a red square player that can move and jump`
* `Add a start screen with a play button and a stylized title`
* `Design flying enemies with animated wings and eyes`
* `Make a HUD showing score, lives, coins, and level number`
* `Create 5 progressively harder levels with moving platforms and spikes`

These instructions produced functional code immediately, with zero manual configuration.

## 🧩 AI Solves Classic Challenges

### 🗂️ Game State Management

```html
<div id="startScreen">
  <button class="play-button" onclick="startGame()">Play Game</button>
</div>
```

* Built-in support for Start, Game Over, and Level Complete screens
* Buttons automatically control game state transitions

### 🏃 Player Movement & Jump Physics

```js
if (jumpKey && !jumpPressed) {
  if (onGround) {
    playerVelY = -jumpPower;
    canDoubleJump = true;
  } else if (canDoubleJump) {
    playerVelY = -doubleJumpPower;
    canDoubleJump = false;
  }
}
```

* AI wrote functional physics with gravity, double-jump logic, and grounded detection

### 👾 Enemy Animations

```css
@keyframes wingFlap {
  0%   { transform: rotateZ(-20deg); }
  100% { transform: rotateZ(20deg); }
}
```

* Enemies include animated wings and eyes, with complete hit detection logic

---

## ⚙️ Development Automation

AI generated:

* 5 unique levels with increasing difficulty
* Moving platforms and coins placed on top
* Hazards like spikes added programmatically

### 🧱 Example

```js
createMovingPlatform(300, 500, 80, 15, 100, 0, 1.5);
createCoin(340, 470); // Coin on moving platform
```

## ✨ Interesting AI-Generated Solutions

### 💰 Coins with Glow & Spin

```css
.coin {
  animation: spin 2s linear infinite, coinGlow 1.5s ease-in-out infinite alternate;
}
```

### 😀 Player Style & Effects

```css
#player::before {
  background: radial-gradient(circle at 25% 40%, #2f3542 3px, transparent 3px);
}
```

* Jumping triggers spin or bounce animations
* Player has cartoon eyes and mouth
